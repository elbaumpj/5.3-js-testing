# 5.3-js-testing
* I completed this assignment during Week 5 at the Iron Yard. The project's purpose was to allow me to become familiar with the JavaScript test fameworks Mocha and Chai as well as to practice writing test Suites. Click the tests.js file inside the tests folder to see how I wrote my test suite. You can also clone the repo if you'd like to get the clone working locally.
